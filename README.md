## UX

### What is it?
MyBookYourBook is a fictional platform for people who love books. Everyone can sign up for an account and with that account the user can offer his own books to other people. 
The books can be sold, but also rented out to other users. 
There are multiple platforms where anybody can sell or buy books. The renting-part of MyBookYourBook is something new. 
It is different from a library, because by stimulating people to rent out their own books the supply of popular books will be a lot bigger. 
In libraries the waiting list for popular books can be very long. 

### Who is the target audience?
People who love to read paper books. 

### The Goal
I really like to read. Some books I like to read, but have no need to keep them. This site is a platform to sell the book on, but also to rent out a book. 
This way, the person who bought the book can earn a little bit of money back and someone with a smaller budget can read a book for a small amount of money.

### Features left to implement
There are loads od extra feature that could be build to make this platform even more appealing:
**Implement Google maps** - So users can search on proximity of books on offer. This makes it easier for the users to take care of the logistics.

**Automate rent-process** - So user can see his saldo.

**Update-profile for want_to_rent** -

**Swap Option** - Build an option for users to swap books (I have this books on offer and am looking for that book).

**Community** - Build a community so users can discuss books and readingtips.

**Recommended list** - Give suggestions to users which books they might like, based on the books they bought, rented and have on sale.

**Wish list** - Let user add books they would like in a wish list and email them when the book is being offered.
